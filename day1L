3:14pm When the peach tree grows in the center without LL knowing about it, an apple tree grows in the LL.
LL sends a request to C so C will adopt this apple tree (sends a pull request). C agrees and pulls. 
3"20 pm CC then decides that he is going to decorate this apple tree with some apples. He adds two apples.
And he will update his own peach tree, and send a pull request for LL to take his updates.
